Common browsers are for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p> <p>What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little helpers. Nearly all websites use cookies. More accurately speaking these are HTTP-cookies, since there are also different cookies for other uses. http-cookies are small files which our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically put into the cookie-folder, which is like the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p> <p>Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g. language or personal page settings. When you re-open our website, your browser submits these “user specific” information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers every cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p> <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party coookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Every cookie is individual, since every cookie stores different data. The expiration time of a cookie also varies – it can be a few minutes, or up to a few years. Cookies are no software-programs and contain no computer viruses, trojans or any other malware. Cookies also cannot access your PC’s information.</p> <p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">name:</strong> _ga<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152121435482-9<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">purpose:</strong> differentiation between website visitors<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">expiration date:</strong> after 2 years</p> <p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p> <ul class="adsimple-121435482"> <li class="adsimple-121435482">at least 4096 bytes per cookie</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">at least 50 cookies per domain</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">at least 3000 cookies in total</li> </ul> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">Which types of cookies are there?</h3> <p>What exact cookies we use, depends on the used services. We will explain this in the following sections of the Privacy Policy statement. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p> <p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Essential Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic function of a website. They are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout. Even when the user closed their window priorly, these cookies ensure that the shopping cart does not get deleted.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Purposive Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies collect info about the user behaviour and record if the user potentially receives any error messages. Furthermore, these cookies record the website’s loading time as well as its behaviour within different browsers.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Target-orientated Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies care for an improved user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts or data in forms stay saved.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Advertising Cookies<br /> </strong>These cookies are also known as targeting-Cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering individually adapted advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p> <p>Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept. Furthermore, this decision will of course also be saved in a cookie.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">How can I delete cookies?</h3> <p>You yourself take the decision if and how you want to use cookies. Thus, no matter what service or website cookies are from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate or only partially allow them. Therefore, you can for example block cookies of third parties but allow any other cookies.</p> <p>If you want change or delete cookie-settings and would like to determine which cookies have been saved to your browser, you can find this info in your browser-settings:</p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Google Chrome Cookies"> Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Safari Cookies"> Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121435482" href=" https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Firefox Cookies"> Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121435482" href=" https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="IE Cookies"> Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121435482" href=" https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4027947/microsoft-edge-delete-cookies?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Edge Cookies"> Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge </a> </p> <p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser in a way, to notify you whenever a potential cookie is about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie. The settings for this differ from browser to browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search phrase “delete cookies Chrome” or “deactivate cookies Chrome” into Google.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">How is my data protected?</h3> <p>There is a “cookie policy” that has been in place since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires the user’s consent. However, among the countries of the EU, these guidelines are often met with mixed reactions. In Austria the guidelines have been implemented in § 96 section 3 of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).</p> <p>If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a>, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called “HTTP State Management Mechanism”.</p> <h2 id="speicherung-persoenlicher-daten-en" class="adsimple-121435482">Storage of Personal Data</h2> <p>Any personal data you electronically submit to us on this website, such as your name, email address, home address or other personal information you provide via the transmission of a form or via any comments to the blog, are solely used for the specified purpose and get stored securely along with the respective submission times and IP-address. These data do not get passed on to third parties.</p> <p>Therefore, we use personal data for the communication with only those users, who have explicitly requested being contacted, as well as for the execution of the services and products offered on this website. We do not pass your personal data to others without your approval, but we cannot exclude the possibility this data will be looked at in case of illegal conduct.</p> <p>If you send us personal data via email – and thus not via this website – we cannot guarantee any safe transmission or protection of your data. We recommend you, to never send confidential data via email.</p> <h2 id="rechte-dsgvo-en" class="adsimple-121435482">Rights in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation</h2> <p>You are granted the following rights in accordance with the provisions of the <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDPR</a> (General Data Protection Regulation) and the Austrian <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Protection Act (DSG)</a>:</p> <ul class="adsimple-121435482"> <li class="adsimple-121435482">right to rectification (article 16 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">right to erasure (“right to be forgotten“) (article 17 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">right to restrict processing (article 18 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">righ to notification – notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing (article 19 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">right to data portability (article 20 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Right to object (article 21 GDPR)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing – including profiling – (article 22 GDPR)</li> </ul> <p>If you think that the processing of your data violates the data protection law, or that your data protection rights have been infringed in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with your respective regulatory authority. For Austria this is the data protection authority, whose website you can access at <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/?tid=121435482">https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/</a>.</p> <h2 id="auswertung-des-besucherverhaltens-en" class="adsimple-121435482">Evaluation of Visitor Behaviour</h2> <p>In the following Privacy Policy, we will inform you on if and how we evaluate the data of your visit to this website.

With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information. You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol, which is situated in your browser’s top left corner, as well as by the use of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.</p> <h2 id="google-analytics-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121435482">Google Analytics Privacy Policy</h2> <p>We use the tracking and analysis tool Google Analytics (GA) of the US-American company Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). Google Analytics collects data on your actions on our website. Whenever you click a link for example, this action is saved in a cookie and transferred to Google Analytics. With the help of reports which we receive from Google Analytics, we can adapt our website and our services better to your wishes. In the following, we will explain the tracking tool in more detail, and most of all, we will inform you what data is saved and how you can prevent this.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">What is Google Analytics?</h3> <p>Google Analytics is a tracking tool with the purpose of conducting data traffic analysis of our website. For Google Analytics to work, there is a tracking code integrated to our website. Upon your visit to our website, this code records various actions you perform on your website. As soon as you leave our website, this data is sent to the Google Analytics server, where it is stored.</p> <p>Google processes this data and we then receive reports on your user behaviour. These reports can be one of the following:</p> <ul class="adsimple-121435482"> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Target audience reports: With the help of target audience reports we can get to know our users better and can therefore better understand who is interested in our service.</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Advertising reports: Through advertising reports we can analyse our online advertising better and hence improve it.</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports provide us helpful information on how we can get more people enthusiastic about our service.</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Behaviour reports: With these reports, we can find out how you interact with our website. By the means of behaviour reports, we can understand what path you go on our website and what links you click.</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Conversion reports: A conversion is the process of leading you to carry out a desired action due to a marketing message. An example of this would be transforming you from a mere website visitor into a buyer or a newsletter subscriber. Hence, with the help of these reports we can see in more detail, if our marketing measures are successful with you. Our aim is to increase our conversion rate.</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Real time reports: With the help of these reports we can see in real time, what happens on our website. It makes us for example see, we can see how many users are reading this text right now.</li> </ul> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?</h3> <p>The objective of our website is clear: We want to offer you the best possible service. Google Analytics’ statistics and data help us with reaching this goal.</p> <p>Statistically evaluated data give us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On the one hand, we can optimise our page in a way, that makes it easier to be found by interested people on Google. On the other hand, the data helps us to get a better understanding of you as our visitor. Therefore, we can very accurately find out what we must improve on our website, in order to offer you the best possible service. The analysis of that data also enables us to carry out our advertising and marketing measures in a more individual and more cost-effective way. After all, it only makes sense to show our products and services exclusively to people who are interested in them.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">What data gets stored by Google Analytics?</h3> <p>With the aid of a tracking code, Google Analytics creates a random, unique ID which is connected to your browser cookie. That way, Google Analytics recognises you as a new user. The next time you visit our site, you will be recognised as a “recurring” user. All data that is collected gets saved together with this very user ID. Only this is how it is made possible for us to evaluate and analyse pseudonymous user profiles.</p> <p>Your interactions on our website are measures by tags such as cookies and app instance IDs. Interactions are all kinds of actions that you perform on our website. If you are also using other Google systems (such as a Google Account), data generated by Google Analytics can be linked with third-party cookies. Google does not pass on any Google Analytics data, unless we as the website owners authorise it. In case it is required by law, exceptions can occur.</p> <p>The following cookies are used by Google Analytics:</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Name:</strong> _ga<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Value:</strong>2.1326744211.152121435482-5<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Purpose:</strong> By deafault, analytics.js uses the cookie _ga, to save the user ID.

These Heatmaps make it possible to see the exact areas you click on, so we can get information on what routes you make on our website.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Session duration:</strong> Google calls the time you spend on our website without leaving it session duration. Whenever you are inactive for 20 minutes, the session ends automatically.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Bounce rate</strong> If you only look at one page of our website and then leave our website again, it is called a bounce.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Account creation:</strong> If you create an account or make an order on our website, Google Analytics collects this data.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">IP-Address:</strong> The IP address is only shown in a shortened form, to make it impossible to clearly allocate it.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Location:</strong> Your approximate location and the country you are in can be defined by the IP address. This process is called IP location determination.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Technical information:</strong> Information about your browser type, your internet provider and your screen resolution are called technical information.</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Source:</strong> Both, Google Analytics as well as ourselves, are interested what website or what advertisement led you to our site.</p> <p>Further possibly stored data includes contact data, potential reviews, playing media (e.g. when you play a video on our site), sharing of contents via social media or adding our site to your favourites. This list is not exhaustive and only serves as general guidance on Google Analytics’ data retention.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">How long and where is the data saved?</h3> <p>Google has servers across the globe. Most of them are in America and therefore your data is mainly saved on American servers. Here you can read detailed information on where Google’s data centres are located: <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en</a> </p> <p>Your data is allocated to various physical data mediums. This has the advantage of allowing to retrieve the data faster, and of protecting it better from manipulation. Every Google data centre has respective emergency programs for your data. Hence, in case of a hardware failure at Google or a server error due to natural disasters, the risk for a service interruption stays relatively low.</p> <p>Google Analytics has a 26 months standardised period of retaining your user data. After this time, your user data is deleted. However, we have the possibility to choose the retention period of user data ourselves. There are the following five options:</p> <ul class="adsimple-121435482"> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Deletion after 14 months</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Deletion after 26 months</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Deletion after 38 months</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Deletion after 50 months</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">No automatical deletion</li> </ul> <p>As soon as the chosen period is expired, the data is deleted once a month. This retention period applies to any of your data which is linked to cookies, user identification and advertisement IDs (e.g. cookies of the DoubleClick domain). Any report results are based on aggregated information and are stored independently of any user data. Aggregated information is a merge of individual data into a single and bigger unit.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3> <p>Under the provisions of the European Union’s data protection law, you have the right to obtain information on your data and to update, delete or restrict it. With the help of a browser add on that can deactivate Google Analytics’ JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js), you can prevent Google Analytics from using your data. You can download this add on at <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB</a>. Please consider that this add on can only deactivate any data collection by Google Analytics.</p> <p>Should you generally want to deactivate, delete or manage all cookies (independently of Google Analytics), you can use one of the guides that are available for any browser:</p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121435482" href=" https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121435482" href=" https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies </a> </p> <p> <a class="adsimple-121435482" href=" https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4027947/microsoft-edge-delete-cookies?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge </a> </p> <p>Google Analytics is an active participant of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which regulates correct and save transfer of personal data.<br /> You can find more information on this at <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&tid=121435482</a>.

We use the data that is stored for the registration for the Newsletter exclusively for our Newsletter and do not pass them on.</p> <p>If you unsubscribe from the newsletter – for which you can find a link in the bottom of every newsletter – we will delete all data that was saved when you registered for the newsletter.</p> <h2 id="mailchimp-datenschutzerklaerung-en" class="adsimple-121435482">MailChimp Privacy Policy</h2> <p>Like many other websites, we use the services of the newsletter company MailChimp on our website. The operator of MailChimp is the company The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA. With the aid of MailChimp we can easily send you interesting news via newsletter. For the use of the service we do not have to install anything but can still access a pool of very efficient features. In the following we will give more details on this email marketing service and will inform you about the most important data protection aspects.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">What is MailChimp?</h3> <p>MailChimp is a cloud-based newsletter management service. “Cloud-based“ means that we do not need to install MailChimp on our own computer or server. Instead, we use the service on an external server, or more specifically via an IT infrastructure, which is available via the internet. Using a software this way is also called SaaS (software as a service).</p> <p>MailChimp allows us to chose from a wide range of different email types. Depending on what goal we want to reach with our newsletter, we can run individual campaigns, regular campaigns, auto responders (automated emails), A/B tests, RSS campaigns (mailings at pre-set times and frequencies) and follow-up campaigns.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">Why do we use MailChimp on our website?</h3> <p>The reason we would use any newsletter service is so we can stay in contact with you. We want to keep you on the loop what news or attractive offers we have for you at the time. As we constantly seek out the easiest and best solutions for our marketing measures, we have decided on MailChimp as our newsletter management service. While the software is very easy to use, it offers many helpful features. For example, it allows us to create interesting and attractive newsletters in only a short time. With integrated design templates we can create every newsletter in an individual way. Due to the “responsive design” feature, our contents are also presented in a readable and pleasant way on your smartphone (or any other mobile device).</p> <p>With tools such as A/B testing or the extensive analysis options, we can swiftly tell how you like our newsletters. This means that we can react if necessary and improve our offer or our services.</p> <p>Another advantage is MailChimp’s “cloud system”. The data is not stored and processed directly on our server. We can retrieve the datafrom external servers and therefore save our memory space and also decrease maintenance effort.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">What data is saved by MailChimp?</h3> <p>Rocket Science Group LLC (MailChimp) operate online platforms which enable us to get in contact with you, provided you subscribed to our newsletter. If you become a subscriber of our newsletter via our website, by email you agree to become a member of a MailChimp email list. Then, MailChimp saves your subscription data and your IP address, so it can verify your entry into the list provider. Moreover, MailChimp stores your email address, your name, your physical address and demographic information, such as language or location.</p> <p>This information is used to send emails to you and to allow certain other MailChimp functions (e.g. the evaluation of newsletters).</p> <p>MailChimp also shares information with third parties to improve its services. Moreover, MailChimp shares certain data with advertising partners of third parties to get a better understanding of its clients’ interests, in order to provide relevant contents and target-oriented advertising.</p> <p>With so-called “web beacons” (small graphics in HTML emails), MailChimp can determine if an email has arrived, has been opened or if links have been clicked. This information is then stored on MailChimp’s servers. That way we receive statistical evaluations and can see how you liked our newsletter. Therefore, we can tailor our offer better to your wishes and improve our service.</p> <p>Moreover, MailChimp are allowed to use this data for improving their own service. Thus, they can for example technically optimise the distribution or determine the location (or the country) of the recipient.</p> <p>The following cookies can be set by MailChimp. The list is not exhaustive and is merely an exemplary selection:</p> <p> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Name</strong>: AVESTA_ENVIRONMENT<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Value: </strong>Prod<br /> <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Purpose:</strong> This cookie is necessary to provide the services of Mailchimp.

This can be the case if your email program does not work or if the newsletter is not displayed properly. The newsletter will then be shown via a MailChimp website. MailChimp also uses cookies on its websites (small text files which save data on your browser).<br /> Personal data can be processed by MailChimp and their partners (e.g. Google Analytics). MailChimp is responsible for the collection of this data and we have no influence on it. MailChimp’s “Cookie Statement” (at: <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mailchimp.com/legal/cookies/</a>) tells you exactly how and why the company uses cookies.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">How long and where is the data saved?</h3> <p>Since MailChimp is an American company, all retained data is stored on American servers.</p> <p>Generally, the data stays permanently saved on MailChimp’s servers and is deleted only when you request it. You can have your contact information with us deleted. This permanently removes all your personal data for us and anonymises you in MailChimp’s reports. However, you can also request the deletion of your data permanently at MailChimp. Then all your data are removed from there and we receive a notification from MailChimp. After we receive the email we have 30 days to delete your contact from all integrations.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3> <p>You can withdraw your approval for the receipt of our newsletters anytime, by clicking the link in the lower area of the received newsletter email. When you click on the unsubscribe link, your data with MailChimp gets deleted.</p> <p>When you land on a MailChimp website via a link in our newsletter and cookies are consequently set in your browser, you can delete or deactivate these cookies anytime.</p> <p>Depending on the browser, the deactivation or deletion differs slightly.

Facebook is a social media network of the company Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2 Ireland. With the aid of this tool we can provide the best possible offers to you and anyone interested in our products and services. In the following we will give you an overview on the different Facebook tools, as well as on what data is sent to Facebook and how you can delete these data.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">What are Facebook tools?</h3> <p>Along with many other products, Facebook also offers so called “Facebook Business Tools”. This is Facebook’s official name for the tools, but it is not very common. Therefore, we decided to merely call them “Facebook tools”. They include the following:</p> <ul class="adsimple-121435482"> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Facebook-Pixel</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">social plugins (e.g. the “Like” or “Share“ button)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Facebook Login</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Account Kit</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">APIs (application programming interface)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">SDKs (Softwart developmept kits)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Plattform-integrations</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Plugins</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Codes</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Specifications</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Documentations</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Technologies and Services</li> </ul> <p>With these tools Facebook can extend its services and is able to receive information on user activities outside of Facebook.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">Why do we use Facebook tools on our website?</h3> <p>We only want to show our services and products to people who are genuinely interested in them. With the help of advertisements (Facebook Ads) we can reach exactly these people. However, to be able to show suitable adverts to users, Facebook requires additional information on people’s needs and wishes. Therefore, information on the user behaviour (and contact details) on our website, are provided to Facebook. Consequently, Facebook can collect better user data and is able to display suitable adverts for our products or services. Thanks to the tools it is possible to create targeted, customised ad campaigns of Facebook.</p> <p>Facebook calls data about your behaviour on our website “event data” and uses them for analytics services. That way, Facebook can create “campaign reports” about our ad campaigns’ effectiveness on our behalf. Moreover, by analyses we can get a better insight in how you use our services, our website or our products. Therefore, some of these tools help us optimise your user experience on our website. With the social plugins for instance, you can share our site’s contents directly on Facebook.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">What data is saved by the Facebook tools?</h3> <p>With the use of the Facebook tools, personal data (customer data) may be sent to Facebook. Depending on the tools used, customer data such as name, address, telephone number and IP address may be transmitted.</p> <p>Facebook uses this information to match the data with the data it has on you (if you are a Facebook member). However, before the customer data is transferred to Facebook, a so called “Hashing” takes place. This means, that a data record of any size is transformed into a string of characters, which also has the purpose of encrypting data.</p> <p>Moreover, not only contact data, but also “event data“ is transferred. These data are the information we receive about you on our website. To give an example, it allows us to see what subpages you visit or what products you buy from us. Facebook does not disclose the obtained information to third parties (such as advertisers), unless the company has an explicit permission or is legally obliged to do so. Also, “event data“ can be linked to contact information, which helps Facebook to offer improved, customised adverts. Finally, after the previously mentioned matching process, Facebook deletes the contact data.</p> <p>To deliver optimised advertisements, Facebook only uses event data, if they have been combined with other data (that have been collected by Facebook in other ways). Facebook also uses event data for the purposes of security, protection, development and research. Many of these data are transmitted to Facebook via cookies. Cookies are little text files, that are used for storing data or information in browsers. Depending on the tools used, and on whether you are a Facebook member, a different number of cookies are placed in your browser. In the descriptions of the individual Facebook tools we will go into more detail on Facebook cookies. You can also find general information about the use of Facebook cookies at <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies?tid=121435482" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies</a>.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">How long and where are the data saved?</h3> <p>Facebook fundamentally stores data, until they are no longer of use for their own services and products. Facebook has servers for storing their data all around the world. However, customer data is cleared within 48 hours after they have been matched with their own user data.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3> <p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you have the right of information, rectification, transfer and deletion of your data.</p> <p>The collected data is only fully deleted, when you delete your entire Facebook account. Deleting your Facebook account works as follows:</p> <p>1) Click on settings in the top right side in Facebook.</p> <p>2) Then, click “Your Facebook information“ in the left column.</p> <p>3) Now click on “Deactivation and deletion”.</p> <p>4) Choose “Permanently delete account“ and then click on “Continue to account deletion“.</p> <p>5) Enter your password, click on “continue“ and then on “Delete account“.</p> <p>The retention of data Facebook receives via our site is done via cookies (e.g. with social plugins), among others.

To do this, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA). With reCAPTCHA we can determine whether you are a real person from flesh and bones, and not a robot or a spam software. By spam we mean any electronically undesirable information we receive involuntarily. Classic CAPTCHAS usually needed you to solve text or picture puzzles to check. But thanks to Google’s reCAPTCHA you usually do have to do such puzzles. Most of the times it is enough to simply tick a box and confirm you are not a bot. With the new Invisible reCAPTCHA version you don’t even have to tick a box. In this privacy policy you will find out how exactly this works, and what data is used for it.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">What is reCAPTCHA?</h3> <p>reCAPTCHA is a free captcha service from Google that protects websites from spam software and misuse by non-human visitors. This service is used the most when you fill out forms on the Internet. A captcha service is a type of automatic Turing-test that is designed to ensure specific actions on the Internet are done by human beings and not bots. During the classic Turing-test (named after computer scientist Alan Turing), a person differentiates between bot and human. With Captchas, a computer or software program does the same. Classic captchas function with small tasks that are easy to solve for humans but provide considerable difficulties to machines. With reCAPTCHA, you no longer must actively solve puzzles. The tool uses modern risk techniques to distinguish people from bots. The only thing you must do there, is to tick the text field “I am not a robot”. However, with Invisible reCAPTCHA even that is no longer necessary. reCAPTCHA, integrates a JavaScript element into the source text, after which the tool then runs in the background and analyses your user behaviour. The software calculates a so-called captcha score from your user actions. Google uses this score to calculate the likelihood of you being a human, before entering the captcha. reCAPTCHA and Captchas in general are used every time bots could manipulate or misuse certain actions (such as registrations, surveys, etc.).</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">Why do we use reCAPTCHA on our website?</h3> <p>We only want to welcome people from flesh and bones on our side and want bots or spam software of all kinds to stay away. Therefore, we are doing everything we can to stay protected and to offer you the highest possible user friendliness. For this reason, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google. Thus, we can be pretty sure that we will remain a “bot-free” website. Using reCAPTCHA, data is transmitted to Google to determine whether you genuinely are human. reCAPTCHA thus ensures our website’s and subsequently your security. Without reCAPTCHA it could e.g. happen that a bot would register as many email addresses as possible when registering, in order to subsequently “spam” forums or blogs with unwanted advertising content. With reCAPTCHA we can avoid such bot attacks.</p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">What data is stored by reCAPTCHA?</h3> <p>reCAPTCHA collects personal user data to determine whether the actions on our website are made by people. Thus, IP addresses and other data Google needs for its reCAPTCHA service, may be sent to Google. Within member states of the European Economic Area, IP addresses are almost always compressed before the data makes its way to a server in the USA.<br /> Moreover, your IP address will not be combined with any other of Google’s data, unless you are logged into your Google account while using reCAPTCHA. Firstly, the reCAPTCHA algorithm checks whether Google cookies from other Google services (YouTube, Gmail, etc.) have already been placed in your browser. Then reCAPTCHA sets an additional cookie in your browser and takes a snapshot of your browser window.</p> <p>The following list of collected browser and user data is not exhaustive. Rather, it provides examples of data, which to our knowledge, is processed by Google.</p> <ul class="adsimple-121435482"> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Referrer URL (the address of the page the visitor has come from)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">IP-address (z.B. 256.123.123.1)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Information on the operating system (the software that enables the operation of your computers. Popular operating systems are Windows, Mac OS X or Linux)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Cookies (small text files that save data in your browser)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Mouse and keyboard behaviour (every action you take with your mouse or keyboard is stored)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Date and language settings (the language and date you have set on your PC is saved)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">All Javascript objects (JavaScript is a programming language that allows websites to adapt to the user. JavaScript objects can collect all kinds of data under one name)</li> <li class="adsimple-121435482">Screen resolution (shows how many pixels the image display consists of)</li> </ul> <p>Google may use and analyse this data even before you click on the “I am not a robot” checkmark. In the Invisible reCAPTCHA version, there is no need to even tick at all, as the entire recognition process runs in the background. Moreover, Google have not given details on what information and how much data they retain.</p> <p>The following cookies are used by reCAPTCHA: With the following list we are referring to Google’s reCAPTCHA demo version at <a class="adsimple-121435482" href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo</a>.<br /> For tracking purposes, all these cookies require a unique identifier.

But even without confirmation from Google, it can be assumed that data such as mouse interaction, length of stay on a website or language settings are stored on the European or American Google servers. The IP address that your browser transmits to Google does generally not get merged with other Google data from the company’s other services.<br /> However, the data will be merged if you are logged in to your Google account while using the reCAPTCHA plug-in. <strong class="adsimple-121435482">Google’s diverging privacy policy applies for this.</strong> </p> <h3 class="adsimple-121435482">How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3> <p>If you want to prevent any data about you and your behaviour to be transmitted to Google, you must fully log out of Google and delete all Google cookies before visiting our website or use the reCAPTCHA software. Generally, the data is automatically sent to Google as soon as you visit our website.
